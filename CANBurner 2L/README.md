# CANBurner 2L

## What is it?

CANBurner is an adaptation of hartk's 2-piece StealthBurner PCB.

CANBurner adapts this concept for use on printers with a CANbus toolhead like the BigTreeTech EBB or the Mellow FLY-SHT.

## What is the L?

Version 2L includes an onboard RGB LED and some unique design choices. We've also added test points for the `5V`, `24V`, and `GND` lines to assist with debugging.

## How does it work?

Just like [hartk's boards](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/PCBs/Stealthburner_Toolhead_PCB) do!

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCIwZRPYMZ8)

Instead of attaching a ribbon, our board just connects to the corresponding pins on your CANbus toolboard.

Its purpose is to act as a "quick-connect" bridge that allows you to remove the stealthburner without disconnecting and reconnecting several connectors for components like fans and LEDs.

The pins will align and connect when you attach the stealthburner front to the extruder.
